# RpgLogsDocs Generator
This script generates a TypeScript compatible definitions file
for the [RpgLogs API](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/scripting-api-docs/warcraft/index.html).
This is file is intended to allow you to write report components or pins in TypeScript.

See [here](https://github.com/JoschiGrey/WCL-TS-Components) for a template project to create components in TS.
